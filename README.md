## 📝 Project Overview

This project implements the **WordCount MapReduce** job using **Hadoop**, applied to the **Enron Email Dataset**. The WordCount job is a foundational example in big data processing — showcasing how large volumes of data can be processed **in parallel** across a cluster using the **MapReduce** paradigm.

---

## 📘 Project Introduction

This project implements a Hadoop MapReduce-based word count analysis on the Enron Email Dataset, a publicly available collection of over 500,000 emails exchanged among employees of the Enron Corporation. Using the **WordCount MapReduce** programs, we process and analyze the textual data to identify the most frequently used words across the email communications.

The goal is to demonstrate how Hadoop can efficiently handle large-scale, unstructured large data (over 1 lakh) using parallel processing. This analysis not only serves as a practical application of distributed computing but also provides insights into communication patterns within a real corporate environment.

## 📂 Dataset: Enron Email Dataset

- Contains approximately **500,000 emails**.
- Emails include **sender**, **receiver**, **subject**, and **body** fields.
- Originally released by the **Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)** during the Enron Corporation investigation.

## ⚙️ MapReduce Workflow

- Here's the documentation link of the steps to Execute Hadoop MapReduce WordCount Job for Enron Email Dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oSjnyfojHq9aw2cUXgijdmIGFjXxmwkU/view?usp=drive_link
  
### 1️⃣ Input
- **Source:** Raw email csv files. (link of the dataset is provided above)
- **Storage:** Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).

### 2️⃣ Splitting
- Hadoop automatically splits the dataset into smaller chunks for distributed processing.

### 3️⃣ Mapper Phase
Each Mapper:
- Reads email text.
- Extracts text from **subject** and **body** fields.
- Tokenizes into words.
- Emits `(word, 1)` key-value pairs.

### 4️⃣ Shuffle & Sort
- Intermediate results are grouped by key (word).
- All occurrences of a word are collected and forwarded to the same Reducer.

### 5️⃣ Reducer Phase
Each Reducer:
- Receives grouped `(word, 1)` pairs.
- Aggregates word counts using summation.
- Emits final output: `(word, total_count)`.

### 6️⃣ Output
- The final word counts are written back to HDFS for further analysis or usage.
- Here is a screenshot of the structure of the final output data after Map-Reducing process using wordcount Map-Reduce:

The structure of the output is in the format: (word, total_count), where each line represents a unique word feature and the number of times it appeared in the dataset.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Apache Hadoop**
- **MapReduce Programming Model**
- **HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)**
- **Java **

---

## 📌 Objective
The primary objective of this MapReduce process is to **efficiently analyze the Enron email dataset (~500,000 emails)** using **Hadoop's distributed computing capabilities**. Specifically, the goal is to **identify and count the frequency of each unique word** across the email dataset, demonstrating Hadoop’s effectiveness in handling **large-scale text processing** tasks.

This project aims to showcase the power of **distributed computing** and **parallel processing** by applying the **MapReduce model** using Apache Hadoop software to analyze a real-world large dataset (over 1 lakh) at scale.
